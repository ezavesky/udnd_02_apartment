### Customizations
In building the apartement, a few steps were taken to go above just what
was in the build requirements.

* Multiple waypoints
* Color spot lights for different parts
* Area spot lights for under-counter interaction
* A number of textured "posters" to enhance the wallspace
* A few animation on objects and "cats" to play with 
* "Soothing" music background for a design studio

**NOTE**: Because there is no rectile associated with the current GVR viewer,
all clicks will toggle the globe spin on and off.
